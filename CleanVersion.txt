Hi! I'm a Senior Software Engineer who has had full time positions as a software engineer since January 2019.

I took my first computer science class at golden west college during the Spring 2013 semester. My first class was java and honestly I did not want to continue. However, I knew that there would be a lot of money in the future if I stuck to it, so I did.

I worked at a defense company and I REFUSE to ever work for another one.

Tell me about your company culture and maybe I'll be interested. My total compensation range is 200-300k.

Thank you for your time.

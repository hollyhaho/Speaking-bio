Hi! My name is Holly Ho and I am a senior software engineer. I'm currently casually in the market and an open to a roles where I'm not the only fucking asian and vietnamese female on your team.

I took my first computer science class in 2013 at golden west college and graduated from CSUF with a bachelors in computer science in Dec 2018. I honestly probably have a lot more experience than you think.

I like to wear make up, smell perfumes, and go to ulta. If you think I would be a good fit for your company, feel free to DM me on any social media platform. I am generally good at replying. If not, remember, I am only one fucking person!
